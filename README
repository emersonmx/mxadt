mxadt is a library of abstract data types (stacks, queues, trees, hash table,
etc.) cross-platform and written in C.

The idea of creating the library, came the need to have a library specializing
in abstract data types.

The current version has been compiled and tested only on GNU / Linux, but with
the course of development, will be given support to other operating systems.

This library is distributed under the GPL v3, which can be found the file
"COPYING".

The test programs can be found in the "test".

If you need help with the library, talk about improvements that can be added
or simply contribute to the project, send me an e-mail I'll be happy to
answer it.

Enjoy!
